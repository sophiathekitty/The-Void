# The Void
source code for a 3d game using [ufps](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/ufps-ultimate-fps-2943) (Not included in repo) that i totally need to revisit or do something with. the main cool thing i figured out with this project was the zone manager system that handles loading and unloading scenes to do seemless zoning.
